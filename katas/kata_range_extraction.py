Description:
A format for expressing an ordered list of integers is to use a comma separated list of either:
- individual integers
- or a range of integers denoted by the starting integer separated from the end integer in the range by a dash, '-'.
The range includes all integers in the interval including both endpoints. It is not considered a range unless it spans at least 3 numbers.
For example "12,13,15-17"
Complete the solution so that it takes a list of integers in increasing order and returns a correctly formatted string in the range format
Example:
solution([-10, -9, -8, -6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20])
# returns "-10--8,-6,-3-1,3-5,7-11,14,15,17-20"
